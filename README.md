# Databricks---GreenYellow-NYC-Taxi-ETL
ETL on NYC Green and Yellow Taxi datasets

New York City has two types of taxies: yellow and green; they are widely recognizable symbols of the city. Taxis painted yellow (medallion taxis) can pick up passengers from anywhere in the five boroughs. Those painted apple green (street hail livery vehicles, commonly known as "boro taxis"), which began to appear in August 2013, are allowed to pick up passengers in Upper Manhattan, the Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens (excluding LaGuardia Airport and John F. Kennedy International Airport), and Staten Island. 

Considering the Volume, Velocity and Veracity aspects of the data, We have decided to build a Data Lake using Databricks Lake House Platform which is going to be a single store for raw intermittent and processed data. 

In this repository we will perform ETL Operation on the Green and Yellow Taxi datasets
